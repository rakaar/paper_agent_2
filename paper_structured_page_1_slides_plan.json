    "audio": "The brain represents sensory information, like the orientation of a visual stimulus, in the coordinated activity of neural populations. The tuning curves of individual neurons collectively define the geometry of this population code. For example, neurons in the visual cortex encoding orientation form a ring-like structure in their state space. However, it's unknown if this same geometric coding principle applies to dynamic cognitive variables, such as decision-making. This is because internal cognitive processes unfold uniquely on single trials and are observed only in the irregular and highly heterogeneous spiking of neurons. This diversity has led many to believe that the neural encoding of cognitive variables follows a fundamentally different, more complex principle than for sensory variables."

    "audio": "Contrary to the prevailing view, we hypothesize that the observed complexity arises from the same coding principle seen in sensory areas. We propose that the neural population dynamics encode a simple cognitive variable, and the diverse firing rates of individual neurons result from their varied tuning to this single variable. To test this, we developed a novel computational approach that can simultaneously infer the population dynamics on single trials and the non-linear tuning functions of individual neurons. This method allows us to discover the governing equations of the dynamics directly from data and reconciles the diversity of single-neuron responses with the encoding of a single, low-dimensional cognitive variable, which in this case is the decision variable."

    "audio": "To gather data, we analyzed spiking activity recorded from the dorsal premotor cortex, or PMd, of two monkeys performing a decision-making task. In this task, the monkeys had to discriminate the dominant color\u2014either red or green\u2014in a static checkerboard stimulus and report their choice. We varied the task difficulty by changing the proportion of colors. As expected, many single neurons in the PMd showed decision-related responses. However, while some neurons had canonical ramping firing rates, most exhibited highly heterogeneous and complex temporal profiles, which at first glance seems incompatible with our hypothesis that they all encode the same simple dynamic decision variable."

    "audio": "To test our hypothesis, we developed a flexible modeling framework that dissociates the dynamics and geometry of neural representations. We model the neural activity on each trial as arising from a single dynamic latent variable, x(t), which represents the evolving decision. Each neuron has a unique, non-linear tuning function to this latent variable, and these functions jointly define the geometry of the neural representation. The dynamics of the latent variable are governed by a general non-linear equation. This framework allows us to model a situation where the underlying dynamics are simple, but the observed neural responses are complex due to the geometry of the tuning functions. By maximizing the model's likelihood, we can simultaneously infer all its key components\u2014the potential function, the initial state, the noise, and the tuning functions of all neurons\u2014directly from the recorded spike data."
